# Numerical-Analysis
Numerical Analysis projects

These projects are an assortment of mathematical and scientific application created 
over the semester during my Numerical Analysis course.

Feel free to grab them for use. 

The following projects are available:
B Spline: performs the b-spline coefficient and b-spline evaluation.
Bisection: uses the bisection algorithm to find the roots of a given equation.
Cone: computes the volume of a cone using a random number generator. 
Cubic Spline: computes the cubic spline.
Loaded Dice: simulates a loaded dice scenario.
Epsilon: Performs a computation to fine epsilon
Limit 1, 2, 3: demonstrates limit properties,by imitating a basic limit operation of the equation: f(x+h)-f(x)/h
Permutation:  demonstrates all the possible name combinations of Russian mathematician P.L. Chebyshev. Can be expanded accordingly.
Gauss: designed to complete Gaussian elimination on a system of linear equations using scaled partial pivoting.
Naive Gauss: Naive Gaussian algorithm for processing systems of linear equations.
Interpolation: aims at using the divided difference method to find the Newton form of the interpolation polynomial.
Least squares: uses the least squares method to predict CPU time as a function of disk I/O's
Newtons method: program uses Newton's method to find the roots of a given equation.
Pi: Calculates Pi
Quadratic forumla: Calculates the quadratic formula
Trapezoid with random numbers: program creates a set of random numbers to fit into a trapezoid
Richardson: computes derivatives using the center differences theorem and Richardson extrapolation. Ultimately leading to faster convergence.
Romberg: computes the Romberg algorithm to approximate a given integral.
Runge-kutta: implements the Runge-Kutta method of order 4
RK4-system: computes the RK4_System algorithm
RK5-system: computes the Runge-Kutta RK45 and Runge-Kutta RK45 adaptive methods for solving ordinary differential equations
Secant method: program is designed to find the roots of a given equation usng the Secant method. Then calculatethe largest positive root to three decimal places.
Simpson: program computes an integral using the Simpson's Rule.
Spline: designed to create a spline function and in the process smooth out linear polynomials.
Taylor: uses the taylor series method to compute a solution for a given equation on a given interval.
Trapezoid: computes the trapezoid method for a given integral.
Hyperbolic: This program uses three functions to define the hyperbolic tangent. The idea being, to look for an accurate value and compare the functions.
